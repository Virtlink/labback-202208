Search the [Issues](https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/awe/labback/-/issues) to ensure the bug has not been reported before.

If the bug is new, open a new issue with a _clear title and description_.
Please indicate:

Try to include as much relevant information as you have.
For example, a code sample or executable test case are very helpful.
